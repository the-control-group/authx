# AuthX Interface

The AuthX Interface is a reference user interface that provides the visual components necessary for a user to authenticate herself and authorize a client to access resources on her behalf.

It is responsible for the entire user-facing portion of the OAuth flow, from authenticating a user to authorizing a client.

The app is written in TypeScript with JSX extensions for react.
